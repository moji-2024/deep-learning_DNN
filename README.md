# Deep Learning Model from Scratch

A Python deep learning project implementing a fully custom neural network for both numeric and image datasets.  
The model supports forward and backward propagation, cost monitoring, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Features
- **Custom Neural Network Implementation** — No high-level ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **CSV Data Training** — Reads and preprocesses numeric datasets.
- **Image Data Training** — Supports loading and flattening image data for training.
- **Performance Metrics** — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score calculation.
- **Flexible Architecture** — Easily adjust number of layers and neurons.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow (PIL)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
